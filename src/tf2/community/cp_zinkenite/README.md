## Notes

* Mesh is left unanalyzed, because all of the extraneous analyzed data, except light intensities, are actually unused in TF2. Light Intensities impact bot visibility, and while it is reasonable to have this behavior in realistic games, in TF2 this can be a detriment. The issue of light can easily be resolved, whether by increasing brightness or just getting better at the game.
