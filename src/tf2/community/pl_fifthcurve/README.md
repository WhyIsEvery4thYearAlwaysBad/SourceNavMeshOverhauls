# Changelog

* Simplified the nav mesh a bit. ([be40da2c](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/SourceNavMeshOverhauls/commit/be40da2c48001877df9e75d0347a5137ab014689))
* Removed RED and BLU One-way attributes in all nav areas at spawn doors. (Reasoning: They cause problems when the round is over, as the opposing team can't get through one of these attributes and the game automatically marks spawn exits.) ([be40da2c](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/SourceNavMeshOverhauls/commit/be40da2c48001877df9e75d0347a5137ab014689))
* Added a shortcut between the 2 stacked metal crates and shack roof at second. ([7deb2305](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/SourceNavMeshOverhauls/commit/7deb2305))
