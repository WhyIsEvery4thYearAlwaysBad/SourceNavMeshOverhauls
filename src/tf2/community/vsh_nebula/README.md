# [vsh_nebula](https://gamebanana.com/mods/74106)

vsh_nebula *requires* the Versus Saxton Hale mod to work properly. Bots do not seem to function properly on this map by default (even with a mesh); I am solely adding a nav mesh for it here in case bots start to function properly again.

## Changelog

* Added initial mesh. ([07759d78](https://github.com/WhyIsEvery4thYearAlwaysBad/SourceNavMeshOverhauls/commit/07759d78))
